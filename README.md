## FAQ

#### What does this plugin do?

This plugin allows users to search through ROBLOX servers for user of choice

#### What is the point?

If you want to join said user while their follow is off you can!

#### How does it work?

It works by searching every single game server for avatar (it matches the cache'd version returned by ROBLOX through one of their API's)

## TODO

- [x] Finish initial extension
- [x] Port the extension over to firefox
- ~~[ ] Fix the extension to work with all users ("bacon hair'd" users and some random users)~~
- [x] Allow for usage with usernames
- ~~[ ] Make a panel for the extension~~
- ~~[ ] Follow user from their profile page~~
